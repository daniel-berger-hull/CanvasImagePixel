	an heuristic that can identify regions of similar color (output can be squares or rectangles)

======
   Simple page created, and an image of the US election of 2016 is loaded and displayed.
   A button been added, that calls a method who can identify the color in the bitmap.


 To DO:
   First experiment would be to try to eleminate the numbers present in the image (which is the electoral count for a state)



Create an inflate box
  start with a point
  then a larger box iteratively x,y --> x-1,y-1 to x+1,y+1 --> x+2,y+2
